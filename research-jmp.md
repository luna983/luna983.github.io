__Measuring the Effectiveness of Poverty Alleviation Programs from Space__

[Hundreds of billions of dollars](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/DT.ODA.ALLD.CD) are spent on development assistance programs every year. How do we know that they are working? More importantly, how do we know which program generates the biggest per-dollar impact?

Right now, most of the evaluations of program effectiveness in developing countries depend on door-to-door surveys. Surveyors would visit people's homes, and conduct interviews for hours, filling out detailed questionnaires that measure every aspect of their financial lives: how much they owe, how much they own, and what they spend money on. These data have been instrumental in helping researchers understand what works, and what doesn't, as well as in directing funding to more effective programs.

However, household surveys are expensive. Researchers easily spend [millions of dollars](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/25/20973151/givedirectly-basic-income-kenya-study-stimulus) on the evaluations alone. They are constantly disrupted by wars, political violence, or, most recently, a pandemic. What if there is a better way?

**What if, instead of measuring a comprehensive list of assets and expenditures, we just measure a few?** Economists have long studied the relationship between households' expenditure on a single good and their overall spending. Notably, Ernst Engel (1821-1896) formulated the "Engel curve", stating that the poorer a family is, the larger the budget share it spends on food. We can leverage this relationship to estimate household economic well being from a small subset of asset or expenditure measures. The intuition is simple - households who own cars are probably wealthier than those who do not; households who live in small houses are probably poorer than those living in mansions.

**What if, instead of conducting door-to-door surveys, we observe a small part of people's expenditures, in particular housing, from space?** In this project, I demonstrated that housing quality can be accurately and cheaply measured with high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning models (Mask R-CNN).

A beautiful idea, but could it really work? Are development aid programs effective enough, for researchers to pick up signals from satellite imagery? To test it, I obtained satellite images, program implementation data, and survey data from a randomized controlled trial, and attempted to reproduce part of the results, only without surveys. The trial studies the effectiveness of [giving out cash directly](https://www.givedirectly.org/), and letting the recipients spend it on what they need the most (instead of relying on aid organizations and donors thousands of miles away to choose for them).

**And it works! I found statistically significant and economically sizeable increases in both overall building footprint and roof reflectance.** More reflective roofs (likely tin roofs) in developing countries are higher quality and more durable, and therefore is commonly used as an indicator for wealth.

These results, obtained without costing a single penny, are consistent with those from expensive door-to-door surveys. Although not as detailed, impact evaluation based on satellite imagery could conceivably complement or even replace door-to-door survey in some cases - when researchers have a small budget, or when the situations on the ground make field work exceedingly difficult.
