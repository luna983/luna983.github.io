__Using Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning to Evaluate the Impact of Anti-Poverty Programs__

([AGU 2019 Abstract](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/507850) \| [GitHub](https://github.com/luna983/beyond-nightlight) \| [Manuscript](/assets/pdf/jmp.pdf) \| [NBER Working Paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29105) \| [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11772))

The rigorous evaluation of anti-poverty programs is key to the fight against global poverty. Traditional approaches rely heavily on repeated in-person field surveys to measure program effects. However, this is costly, time-consuming, and often logistically challenging. Here we provide the first evidence that we can conduct such program evaluations based solely on high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning methods. Our application estimates changes in household welfare in a recent anti-poverty program in rural Kenya. Leveraging a large literature documenting a reliable relationship between housing quality and household wealth, we infer changes in household wealth based on satellite-derived changes in housing quality and obtain consistent results with the traditional field-survey based approach. Our approach generates inexpensive and timely insights on program effectiveness in international development programs.
