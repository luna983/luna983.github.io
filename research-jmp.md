__Measuring the Effectiveness of Poverty Alleviation Programs from Space__

The use and popularization of night light data in economics allowed researchers to, for the first time, measure growth for sub-national regions across the globe, even in countries with poor national accounts data. I show that the use of high-resolution daytime satellite data, combined with deep learning methods, promises to improve upon the night light data in several dimensions, and opens up new possibilities for economic research. I find that applying state-of-the-art machine learning models (e.g., Mask RCNN) on high-resolution satellite data generates spatially disaggregated measures of housing consumption, a good proxy for economic development. With validation exercises against Mexican census data, I demonstrate that these housing consumption measures are (1) more sensitive than night lights in poor and rural regions, and (2) captures local variations in wealth inequality. These measures also (3) have a higher spatial resolution than night lights, which allows researchers to make use of fine spatial variations, such as those generated by most randomized controlled trials (RCTs). I estimate treatment effects from a large unconditional cash transfer (GiveDirectly) in western Kenya and obtain similar results as extensive in-person surveys.
