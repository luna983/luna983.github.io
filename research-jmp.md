__Measuring the Effectiveness of Poverty Alleviation Programs from Space__

Household surveys are expensive. In this project, I argue that housing, a strong correlate of wealth, can be accurately and cheaply measured with high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning models, and can be used to conduct impact evaluations with much lower costs. In Western Kenya, I evaluate the GiveDirectly randomized controlled trial, a large unconditional cash transfer program, with satellite imagery, and observe statistically significant and economically sizeable increases in overall building footprint and roof reflectance, a proxy for housing quality. Using an Engel curve approach, I infer overall treatment effects from observed increases in the consumption of housing, and obtain consistent resultswith extensive in-person surveys.

Figure 1: The figure below shows 10 sets of randomly sampled prediction results generated by the Mask RCNN model. The model performs well with a recall of 0.79 and a precision of 0.80.

Figure 2: The figure below reports estimated average treatment effects of the GiveDirectly unconditional cash transfer on total square footage of buildings, roof reflectance, and nightlight values. x-axis represents the intensity of the cash inflow (in nominal USD) to each pixel (covering an area of 0.012 square kilometers). y-axis represents the magnitude of the treatment effects. Red points represent the point estimates, error bars correspond to the 95% confidence intervals. Gray lines indicate estimated treatment effects from 100 placebo simulations. Panel title reports pooled estimates with a linear effect assumption, along with 95% confidence intervals.
