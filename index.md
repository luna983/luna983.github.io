## Bio

Luna is a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley interested in development economics and data science. She is particularly interested in leveraging granular remote sensing data and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to improve measures of economic development in regions with poor official statistics, and evaluate policy effectiveness in international development.

Luna is currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Agricultural and Resource Economics, at University of California, Berkeley](https://are.berkeley.edu), working with [Ted Miguel](http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/) and [Marco Gonzalez-Navarro](https://are.berkeley.edu/users/marco-gonzalez-navarro). Prior to joining UC Berkeley, she received a B.A. in Economics and a B.S. in Environmental Sciences from Peking University, China.
