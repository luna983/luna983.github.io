### Bio

Luna is a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley, working on research at the intersection of development economics and machine learning. Her work explores how new technologies such as high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning can be used for social good, e.g. -

* [to track the long-term effects of climate change in post-war aerial photos (in the Caribbean)](http://luna-yue-huang.com/research-aerial.html)
* [to help governments and NGOs "see" poverty from space (in Kenya)](http://luna-yue-huang.com/research-jmp.html)
* [to combat manipulation of air pollution data with remote sensing (in China)](http://luna-yue-huang.com/research-pollution.html)

A PhD candidate in [Agricultural and Resource Economics, at University of California, Berkeley](https://are.berkeley.edu) and a doctoral fellow at the [Global Policy Lab](http://www.globalpolicy.science/new-cover-page), Luna works with [Edward Miguel](http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/), [Marco Gonzalez-Navarro](https://are.berkeley.edu/users/marco-gonzalez-navarro) and [Solomon Hsiang](http://www.globalpolicy.science/solomon-hsiang).

Prior to joining UC Berkeley, she received a BA in Economics and a BS in Environmental Science from Peking University, China.

In May 2020, Luna joined a confidential project in [Google X](https://x.company/), continuing her work in causal inference and machine learning. She will be working as a part-time data scientist at Google X till December 2020.

__Update:__ Luna is on the 2021 job market, actively looking for data scientist or economist roles in the US/Canada.
