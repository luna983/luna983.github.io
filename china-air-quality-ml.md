In command-and-control regulations, information asymmetry between central regulators and local agents is often cited as one of the key issues leading to ineffective policies. We provide evidence from China that policies aimed at reducing information asymmetry between central and local government is rather ineffective in improving air quality. This issue has been traditionally hard to examine with administrative and survey data, because credible information on environmental quality were rarely available to researchers before they were available to central regulators. We leverage recent development in machine learning and a rich set of satellite images from NASA and reconstructed a comprehensive air pollution dataset in China with almost half a million observations from 2005 to 2016. We exploit variation in the roll-out of a policy from 2013 to 2015, where treated cities started monitoring and reporting air pollution to upper-level government. We test for structural breaks around the time of policy treatment and find no significant effects. These results have large implications for the recent surge in investments in building the national monitoring network in China.
