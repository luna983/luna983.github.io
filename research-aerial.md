__Understanding the Effects of Climate Change on Mass Migration Using 1.6 Million Historical Aerial Photographs__

_joint with Solomon Hsiang, Andreas Madestam, Anna Tompsett, Hannah Druckenmiller, Nicklas Nordfors, and Trinetta Chong_

Since the 1940s, how have extreme climatic events and climate changes affected economic development across Africa and the Caribbean? At the same time, will climatic events drive mass migration? Who is largely at risk? How many could move and where will they go?

The scarcity and low granuality of historical census and survey data in less developed regions prevented researchers from studying these questions of global importance. We propose to overcome this challenge by developing the first historical high-resolution reconstruction of population density, urban extent and land use maps across Africa and the Caribbean Islands.

We are in the process of digitizing, pre-processing and georeferencing an archive of 1.6 million historical aerial photographs originally taken to map the former British Empire. These images span 27 countries and 60 years, and promise to generate unique insights into consequences and adaptation responses to long-term climate change.
