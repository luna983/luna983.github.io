__Using Randomized Controlled Trials to Estimate Long-Run Impacts in Development Economics__

_joint with Adrien Bouguen, Michael Kremer, Edward Miguel_

([__Published Version on Annual Review of Economics__](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-economics-080218-030333) &#124; [__NBER Working Paper Version__](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25356) &#124; [__Vox Talks__](https://voxeu.org/vox-talks/rcts-long-run))

__Abstract__: We assess evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on long-run economic productivity and living standards in poor countries. We first document that several studies estimate large positive long-run impacts, but that relatively few existing RCTs have been evaluated over the long run. We next present evidence from a systematic survey of existing RCTs, with a focus on cash transfer and child health programs, and show that a meaningful subset can realistically be evaluated for long-run effects. We discuss ways to bridge the gap between the burgeoning number of development RCTs and the limited number that have been followed up to date, including through new panel (longitudinal) data; improved participant tracking methods; alternative research designs; and access to administrative, remote sensing, and cell phone data. We conclude that the rise of development economics RCTs since roughly 2000 provides a novel opportunity to generate high-quality evidence on the long-run drivers of living standards.
